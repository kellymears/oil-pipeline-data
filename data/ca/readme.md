## Pipeline transportation occurrence data

[PODSdb_VW_INJURIES_PUBLIC.csv and PODSdb_VW_OCCURENCE_PUBLIC.csv](http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/pipeline/data-2.asp)

### Datasets from January 1979
With a view to advancing transportation safety, the TSB is publishing data from its Pipeline Occurrence Database System (PODS) on reportable accidents and incidents (which together are called occurrences) for use by industry and the public. The TSB gathers these data in the course of its investigations and uses them to analyze safety deficiencies and identify risks in the Canadian transportation system.

Accidents and incidents are reported in accordance with the TSB Regulations that were in effect at the time of the occurrence.

Accident and incident data prior to 1990 are provided on an as-is basis, as they were not collected by the TSB.

### Content of the datasets
Some data collected by the TSB and recorded in PODS will be excluded from the public database to protect third-party, personal and privileged information, in accordance with the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act, the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act.

The data in text fields are provided in English and in French, while free-text fields contain data in the language in which they were entered. Some of the data in these bilingual datasets are from sources not subject to the Official Languages Act and are therefore available only in the language in which they were provided.

### Release schedule
The PODS datasets are released on or soon after the 15th of each month, and contain data from January 1979 to the last day of the month preceding their release.

### Disclaimer
The datasets are for information purposes only. The user of the data assumes all responsibilities for their use and for verifying Their completeness and accuracy for both critical and non-critical uses and applications.

The data in PODS have been provided by the TSB and/or extracted from third-party sources believed to be reliable. As many occurrences are not fully investigated by the TSB (see the Occurrence Classification Policy), information pertaining to some occurrences may not have been validated. Consequently, these datasets are provided on an as-is basis, and the TSB does not warrant their quality, accuracy, reliability, or completeness.

In no event will the TSB be liable for any direct, special, indirect, consequential or other damages, however caused, arising out of or in connection with the use of any data contained in these datasets. If you find any errors, please report them to communications@bst-tsb.gc.ca.
