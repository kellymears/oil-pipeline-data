"1 HVP means high vapour pressure as defined in Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662.
2 LVP means low vapour pressure as defined in Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662.
3 As of July 2014, the minimum reporting threshold for releases of low vapour pressure hydrocarbons was established at 1.5m3.",,,,,,
