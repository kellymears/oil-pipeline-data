"Data extracted November 15, 2017",,,,,,
"1 With the coming into force of new TSB Regulations in July 2014, the definitions of accident and incident were adjusted and some of the occurrence reporting criteria were modified. For example, the minimum reporting threshold for releases of low vapour pressure hydrocarbons was set to 1.5 m3.
2 HVP means high vapour pressure as defined in Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662.
3 LVP means low vapour pressure as defined in Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662.",,,,,,
